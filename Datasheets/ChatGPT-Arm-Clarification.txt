% llm with this code 'double L1 = 40.0; // Length of the first arm
  double L2 = 30.0; // Length of the second arm

  double angle1_rad = atan2(y, x); // Calculate the angle of the base servo' being used to control a robotic arm, what would the sensible unit of measurement be for the 40 and 30 lengths, and are these measurements from shoulder to elbow and then elbow to wrist or what
The sensible unit of measurement for the lengths 40 and 30 would be in either millimeters (mm) or centimeters (cm) as these lengths are typically measured in metric units in robotics and engineering applications.

Based on the context of the code provided, where we are calculating the angle of the base servo for a robotic arm, it is likely that the lengths 40 and 30 refer to the lengths of the robotic arm segments from shoulder to elbow and elbow to wrist respectively. These lengths are important in determining the positions and movements of the various joints in the robotic arm.
